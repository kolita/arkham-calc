        <item>Arkham Horror uses dice rolls to determine the outcome of a number of events in the game, including combat and skill checks. Each such event will have a stated difficulty, which is defined as the number of successed required to pass the event.</item>
        <item>For some events in Arkham Horror, it is possible to attempt the check more than one time. An example is combat - if a monster deals a one point of damage per round of combat, and your character currently has three stamina, you can attempt the combat check three times before your characters is knocked unconscious.</item>
